# rayshud-mod

I modified the mainmenuoverride.res file from rayshud to my liking. The changes I have made are:

+ add server browser and create server buttons

+ add a viewmodel toggle button that toggles r_drawviewmodel

+ group the buttons and space the groups apart

- remove the casual rank panel and the friends list

# Installation instructions.
if you don't have rayshud already installed, get it from https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud and install it first.

- Navigate to Team Fortress 2's local files through your steam library by right clicking the game and clicking browse local files under the manage tab.

- Navigate to tf\custom\rayshud\customizations\main_menu\

- Rename the existing mainmenuoverride.res to mainmenuoverride.res.bak

- Copy the mainmenuoverride.res file from this repo to the folder

I modified the mainmenuoverride.res file from rayshud to my liking. The changes I have made are:

- Add server browser and create server buttons
- Add a viewmodel toggle button that toggles r_drawviewmodel
- Add an HTML motd toggle button for convenience, I keep HTML motd's off most of the time because community servers use them for advertisements but sometimes you need to enable them for certain features like leaderboards and "contracts"
- Group the buttons and space the groups apart
- Remove the casual rank panel and the friends list as I have little use for them, you can manage parties using the steam overlay

# Installation instructions.
NOTE: I made this modification to an 2020 release of rayshud and rayshud has changed quite a lot in 2 years. I haven't checked if this mod still works with the latest version of rayshud

if you don't have rayshud already installed, get it from https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud and install it first.

- Navigate to Team Fortress 2's local files through your steam library by right clicking the game and clicking browse local files under the manage tab.
- Navigate to tf\custom\rayshud\customizations\main_menu\
- Rename the existing mainmenuoverride.res to mainmenuoverride.res.bak
- Copy the mainmenuoverride.res file from this repo to the folder

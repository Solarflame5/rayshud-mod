# rayshud-mod
modified rayshud main menu

I modified the mainmenuoverride.res file from rayshud(https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud) to my liking. The changes I have made are:

+ add server browser and create server buttons

+ add a viewmodel toggle button that toggles r_drawviewmodel

+ group the buttons and space the groups apart

- remove the casual rank panel and the friends list
